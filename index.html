				<p>Hello! This is a site that will give a basic overview of my interests! 
				My top 4 interests are Yoga, Web Design & Development, Reading, and Games. 
				I <em>love</em> yoga because it makes me feel at peace with anything that could happen. 
				My job is doing Web Design & Development, and I love it! 
				I work for a technology company that works a lot with Wordpress, and here I want to show you some of my work.
				I read whenever I am not working, sleeping, eating, or doing yoga! My current read is Z: A Novel of Zelda Fitzgerald.
				I love Gaming. I play PC games and my all time favorite game is Half-Life 2. 
				Enjoy learning about me!</p>

				<h2>My work</h2>
				<p>I love what I do. I learned html & css(but know there is SO MUCH MORE to learn) a few years ago, and decided to go to school for it!
				ever since then, I have been working on developing Wordpress sites to make some money. What 
				a great opportunity I have, to gain knowledge and experience simultaneously in a field I love!

			  	<h2>Reading</h2>
				<h3>Currently Reading: <strong>Z: A Novel of Zelda Fitzgerald by Therese Anne Fowler</strong></h3>
				<img src="images/zelda.jpg" alt="book cover" title="Z: A Novel of Zelda Fitzgerald">
				<article>
				<aside>April 10, 2013 7:13 PM PST</aside>
				<p> Brief Synopsis: She has always been known as the girl behind the man, but truly she had almost as much influence over F. Scott's novels than he did!
				Although her righting gets overlooked, Zelda is a fast talking twenties girl like no other. Quick of wit, and strong of character, this book brings life to 
				the person that is well deserved. </p>
				<p> My Impressions so far: The dialogue that Zelda uses in this novel is so fast paced that you wonder if their brains worked
				differently back then. Her wit shines out with every sentence and word that she says, which makes it hard to get bored with this novel.
				And if one of the best characters I have ever read isn't enough, the story is amazing to! It chronicles the love and life of Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald.
				From love affairs, to competition with Hemingway, to insane asylums. Did I mention I love this book!?
